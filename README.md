# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
 Find the shortest path that passes through all cities using Generic Algorithm

Developed an app that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using Python and Genetic Algorithm.<br />
• Responsible for developing Crossover and Mutation algorithms for the Generic Algorithm.<br />
• Applied One Point Crossover to produce children without repetition and Insertion Mutation to introduce completely new children.<br />
• Applied Recursion in Insertion Mutation method that resulted in a short and easy to read algorithm.<br />
