# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

Developed an app that finds the shortest path to visit all given cities using Python. <br>
• Responsible for developing partially mapped crossover algorithm and insertion mutation algorithm for 
genetic algorithm. <br>
• Applied recursion and code comment to improve algorithm readability. <br>
• Resulted in an optimal path with the shortest distance with a short and easy to read algorithm. <br>
